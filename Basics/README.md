### Project Overview

 A student management system at any University essentially helps the administration to not only maintain & update accurate records but also helps them in gauging student performances year-on-year, which can consequently help them in awarding scholarships or other incentives to meritorious students. 


### Learnings from the project

 Through this project, I have learnt the basics of Python by making use of preliminary concepts like creating dictionaries, appending & removing elements from it and simple functions like max of all numbers, sum, upper-case & lower-cases, percentage calculations and so on.
